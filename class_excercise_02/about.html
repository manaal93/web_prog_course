                <p>
                Hi! My name is <strong>Manaal Khan</strong>, and I’m currently studying
                <strong>Data Science</strong> at <strong>Lingnan University</strong>. I’m working
                toward becoming a <strong>Data Analyst</strong> and enjoy exploring how data can
                help solve real problems and guide meaningful decisions.
                </p>

                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>
                At Lingnan University, I’m learning the foundations of data science — including
                how data is collected, cleaned, analyzed, and presented. I enjoy turning raw
                information into understandable insights and exploring ways to communicate
                findings clearly and visually.
                </p>

                <h2>What I Enjoy Working On</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Exploring datasets and identifying trends</li>
                <li>Using analytical thinking to solve problems</li>
                <li>Organizing and presenting information clearly</li>
                <li>Learning new tools and improving my skills step-by-step</li>
                <li>Practicing visual storytelling through data</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <p>
                My goal is to continue strengthening my knowledge in data analysis and build a
                growing portfolio of projects. I hope to work as a Data Analyst in the future,
                using data to support smarter decisions and contribute to useful solutions in
                different industries.
                </p>

                <h2>Life Outside of Tech</h2>
                <p>Outside of academics and data, I enjoy spending time on activities that keep me curious and inspired:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Travelling</strong> — discovering new places and experiences</li>
                <li><strong>Chess</strong> — challenging my strategic thinking</li>
                <li><strong>Trying new activities</strong> — exploring something different whenever I can</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why I Built This Website</h2>
